# Intro 
Assumed that we have N players in the soccer fields in order. Each player can do "<>^v" which
means UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. 

A player cannot move to the position that is occupied by other player. Return number of successful moves. 
For example: 
N = "<<>>" ->  moves = 4
N = "^v><" -> moves = 2
N = ">>>>" -> moves = 1
